     <h2>About Jared</h2>
     <p>Jared began his culinary career <span id="exp_year"></span> years ago when his family opened their first restaurnt in the California Bay Area. 
    His progression in the restaurnt industry led him to take up positions in major cities like San Francisco and Chicago where he gained invaluable knowledge on fine dining and advanced cooking techniques. 
In 2015 he relocated to San Diego and after working several years in the healthcare industry he decided to make the switch to becoming a personal chef to use his experience with diverse cuisines and specialty diets to provide 
unparalled support to his community</p>
    <p>As a mostly self-taught chef, Jared has cultivated a mastery of the <em>science</em> behind the ingredients he works with that separates himself from most other classically trained chefs who can restriced to 
    more conservative techniques and rigid executions. If you are interested in requesting Jared's services, do not forget to <a href="request.html" title="Service Request form">fill out a service request</a> so he may better understand your needs!</p>
